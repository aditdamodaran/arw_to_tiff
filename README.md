# arwhatever

A short Python script that converts Sony .ARW files into .jpg format.

## Dependencies

- [os-sys](https://pypi.org/project/os-sys/)
- [rawpy](https://pypi.org/project/rawpy/)
- [imageio](https://pypi.org/project/imageio/)
- [shutil](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-shutil/)

## How To Use

1. Install the dependencies above using Shell in Linux, Terminal in Mac, or [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) in Windows.
2. Plonk all of the .ARW files you wish to convert into an empty/newly-created directory.
3. Drag "arwhatever.py" into the same directory.
4. Run the script.
5. Your .ARW files have now been converted into .jpg file formats. Each image type has been separated into newly-created "dump" directories.
6. Have a cup of tea.

## Roadmap

Next version will include:
- GUI
- Option to export to common image types such as .png or .tiff
